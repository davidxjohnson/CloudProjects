## Summary
- **Jest**: Most stable and widely adopted. Great for large, critical, or legacy projects. Rich ecosystem and low migration risk.
- **Vitest**: Fast, modern, and Vite-native. Best for new TypeScript/Vite/ESM projects. Migration risk is higher due to frequent breaking changes.
- **Mocha/Chai**: Flexible, classic, and stable. Good for legacy codebases or when custom setup is needed.
- **Jasmine**: Older, less popular, but still reliable for small or legacy projects.

## Recommendation
- Use **Jest** for business-critical, long-lived, or legacy projects.
- Use **Vitest** for modern, greenfield Vite/TypeScript projects where speed and ESM support are priorities.
- Use **Mocha/Chai** for projects needing custom test setups or gradual migration from older frameworks.
- Use **Jasmine** only for maintaining legacy codebases.
