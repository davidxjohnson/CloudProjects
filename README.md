TypeScript cloud development projects demonstrating AWS infrastructure, DevOps automation, and testing practices.

> **Documentation:** [Technical Overview](docs/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md) | [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

## **Project Goals**

This monorepo demonstrates:
- **TypeScript Development**: Strict typing with ES modules and modern standards
- **Monorepo Management**: Efficient workspace organization with pnpm
- **AWS Infrastructure as Code**: Real-world AWS infrastructure deployments using CDK
- **AWS SDK Best Practices**: Well-structured, type-safe AWS SDK usage examples
- **Professional Testing**: Comprehensive test suites with 90%+ code coverage (with mocks)
- **Modern CI/CD**: Automated testing, security scanning, and quality gates

## **What You'll Find Here**

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Production EKS Cluster** [`aws-cdk-examples/eks/`]
Complex infrastructure deployment with AWS CDK - Multi-AZ cluster, IAM policies, VPC networking, one-command deployment

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Pod Management** [`aws-sdk-examples/list-pods/`]  
Professional TypeScript architecture (using K8S SDK) with 97.61% test coverage - Clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, comprehensive mocking

### ‚ö° **Lambda Function Management** [`aws-sdk-examples/list-lambdas/`]
AWS Lambda management with TypeScript - List and manage Lambda functions using AWS SDK best practices with comprehensive error handling, high code coverage with use of Mock.

### üîÑ **Refactoring Case Study** [`docs/REFACTORING_FOR_TESTABILITY_OVERVIEW.md`]
