A professional-grade TypeScript monorepo containing AWS CDK infrastructure projects and AWS SDK code examples with comprehensive CI/CD, testing, and quality assurance.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This monorepo uses pnpm workspaces for package management.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.20.0+ (recommended) or Node.js 18.19.1+ (minimum)
- pnpm package manager
- AWS CLI configured (for CDK projects)
- kubectl configured (for Kubernetes examples)

### Important: Use pnpm, not npm
This is a **pnpm monorepo**. Always use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm`:
- `pnpm install` (not `npm install`)
- `pnpm build` (not `npm run build`)
- `pnpm --filter <package>` (for package-specific commands)

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Working with CDK Projects
```bash
# Deploy the EKS cluster
cd aws-cdk-examples/eks
pnpm deploy
```

### Running SDK Examples
```bash
# Run a specific example
pnpm --filter @cloud-projects/list-lambdas-example build
pnpm --filter @cloud-projects/list-lambdas-example start

# Or navigate to the example directory
cd aws-sdk-examples/list-lambdas
pnpm build && pnpm start
```
