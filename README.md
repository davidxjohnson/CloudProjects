A professional-grade TypeScript monorepo containing AWS CDK infrastructure projects and AWS SDK code examples with comprehensive CI/CD, testing, and quality assurance.

## üöÄ Development Workflow

This project uses **branch protection** and **pull request workflow** to maintain code quality.

### üîÑ Quick Start (New Workflow)

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
./scripts/pr-workflow.sh start feature/my-awesome-feature

# 2. Make your changes...

# 3. Validate locally (always do this!)
./scripts/pr-workflow.sh validate

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"

# 5. Push and create PR
./scripts/pr-workflow.sh push
# This gives you a GitHub PR link - click it to create the PR

# 6. Wait for CI/CD to pass, then merge!
```

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.19.1 (pinned for stability)
- pnpm 10.14.0 (managed via package.json)
- AWS CLI configured (for CDK projects)
- kubectl configured (for Kubernetes examples)

### Important: Use pnpm, not npm
This is a **pnpm monorepo**. Always use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm`:
- `pnpm install` (not `npm install`)
- `pnpm build` (not `npm run build`)
- `pnpm --filter <package>` (for package-specific commands)

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Working with CDK Projects
```bash
# Deploy the EKS cluster
cd aws-cdk-examples/eks
pnpm deploy
```

### Running SDK Examples
```bash
# Run a specific example
pnpm --filter @cloud-projects/list-lambdas-example build
pnpm --filter @cloud-projects/list-lambdas-example start

# Or navigate to the example directory
cd aws-sdk-examples/list-lambdas
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

## Project Goals

This monorepo demonstrates:
- **AWS Infrastructure as Code**: Real-world AWS infrastructure deployments using CDK
- **AWS SDK Best Practices**: Well-structured, type-safe AWS SDK usage examples
- **Professional Testing**: Comprehensive test suites with 97.61% code coverage
- **Modern CI/CD**: Automated testing, security scanning, and quality gates
- **Monorepo Management**: Efficient workspace organization with pnpm
- **TypeScript Development**: Strict typing with ES modules and modern standards
